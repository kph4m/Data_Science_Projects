# Project Overview

By completing this project, we sought to explain how the COVID-19 Bubble affected the home team advantage and altered NBA Playoff game statistics. To answer our question, we compiled game statistics from the 2015-2019 Playoff seasons, comparing them to those generated during the 2020 Bubble. We performed several statistical analyses, determining which game statistics changed significantly. Our results reveal that the Bubble playoffs eliminated the home team advantage. For both home and away teams, although their overall defensive statistics remained the same, offensive statistics improved. They suggest that the superior performance by the away teams was the primary factor contributing to the reduced win rate of the home teams.
